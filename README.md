Page made in php using just PHP, HTML, SCSS (transpiled to CSS) and JS

I'm not adding `img` directory with all photos, if you need any upload them with `upload.php`

If you want to use this code, you need to set connection info to MySQL database in `includes/dbh.inc.php` and `includes/logdb.php` and create tables `user` and `gallery` or any other name you set in those files.
